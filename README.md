## Task
At maximum, take 2 flags, -c and -t, which specify a secret code, and a maximum amount of attempts for playing the game. If no flags are 
specified, then a radom secret code is generated and a default of 10 max attempts is used. The user uses a CLI to input a guess, a 4
digit code. If the code entered does not match the actual secret code, then the user is told how many of their digits are correct, and in
the right place (well placed pieces), as well as how many digits are correct, but are in the wrond place (misplaced pieces). If the user
guesses correctly before the max allowed attempts is reached, a message is printed to the standard output ("Congratz! You did it!"). If
they do not guess the correct code, the program is terminated with out a message.

Also if an invalid input is given by the user (any character that is not a digit 0 - 7), "Wrong input!" is printed to the standard output.
A wrong input does not count as an attempt
